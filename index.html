    <h1>Private Island Resort</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to our Home! </h2>
    <h3>Thank you for visiting us</h3>

    <p>A swirl of turquoise and aquamarine lagoons cradle Gladden, an island fringed with coral and white sand in the heart of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System. This island jewel harbors your own private sanctuary, a casually elegant villa designed for just one couple, with the all-inclusive service of a luxury resort. There is a second master suite should you wish to share Gladden with friends or family. Our staff resides unseen on the smaller island behind Gladden,  ready to respond to any request at a moment’s notice. A “privacy meter” indicates if a member of the team is on the main island for any reason, because we want our guests to feel free to be themselves. There are no other neighbors – it’s just you and the views.</p>
    
    <h6>We hope you enjoy:)</h6>
